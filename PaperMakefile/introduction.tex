\section{Introduction}

This fake paper amazingly copies some parts of wikipedia.
It is just used as an illustration purpose.

This paper gives an example {\tt .gitignore} file that ignores anything that matches {\tt mypaper.*} but keeps the bib and tex file(s).
The ignore file also contains various things produced by the Makefile.
